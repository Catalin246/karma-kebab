1. Authorization Code Flow (Recommended for Most Cases)
Best for: Web apps, SPAs, or mobile apps where security is critical.

How it Works:

The user is redirected to Keycloak's hosted login page.
The user logs in with their username and password.
The app receives an authorization code and exchanges it for an access token.
Advantages:

The application never handles the user's password directly.
Secure, as it offloads authentication to Keycloak.
Supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) and third-party identity providers.
Reduces the risk of password-related vulnerabilities in your application.
Disadvantages:

Slightly more complex to implement due to the need for redirection and token exchange.
Recommended For:

Applications where security is a priority.
Scenarios where you need centralized authentication, SSO, or third-party identity providers.
